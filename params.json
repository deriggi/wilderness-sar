{"name":"Wilderness-sar","tagline":"MSc Disseratation","body":"### Abstract.\r\nSearch and rescue cases studies offer interesting insights into the thought process of a lost person. There is evidence that the behavior of a lost person is inextricably linked to how they perceive the problem of being lost. If panic presides, then behavior could be irrational, repetitive, and counter-intuitive. If a calm, disciplined, and problem-solving mindset takes reign, then the patterns of motion are predictable and are often the product of a careful evaluation of options. Regardless of a person’s mindset, some wilderness environments have within them only a few places traversable by someone with average athletic ability. Considering that, the combination of a person’s mindset and the terrain on which they’re lost should be reasonable input variables into a model attempting to predict the lost person’s most likely path. Taken a significant step further, if unmanned aerial vehicles enabled with terrain recognition and navigation capabilities derived from basic artificial intelligence principles could harness such a model, then they should also be able to efficiently search for lost people across a space of wilderness. If achievable in the real world, search and rescue teams could become more effective, less costly, and less dangerous to those doing the searching.\r\n \r\nThis medley of psychology, technology, and wilderness is explored through the use of a bespoke agent based simulation in which lost persons are pitted against their own disorientation and a Nevada mountain range. Developing the simulation and running evaluations with various agent types revealed demonstrable effects of the agents’ ability to navigate unfamiliar terrain and their likelihood of being detected by person-seeking aerial vehicles. More thoughtful and less erratic lost-person behavior makes it more likely for the agent to travel far from its starting location. Lost persons considering a smaller set of options were more often detected by the search vehicles. From the air, teams that collaborated on route quality were more likely to make detections. Developing a set of nuanced lost person agents was the focus of the development. Further research could improve this study by building more diversity into the search vehicle behaviors and the geography of the wilderness.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
